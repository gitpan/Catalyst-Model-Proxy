[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This is the Catalyst Model Class called "Catalyst::Model::Proxy" that
       implements Proxy Design Pattern. It enables you to make calls to target
       classes/subroutines via proxy mechanism. This means reduced memory
       footprint because any operations performed on the proxies are forwarded
       to the original complex ( target_class ) object. The target class model
       is also cached for increased performance. For more information on the
       proxy design pattern please refer yourself to:
       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_design_pattern
